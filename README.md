# PC parts network

Neural network based on Tensorflow, that classifies images of PC parts.

This repository is a project for Artificial Intelligence classes on my university, conducted by dr in≈º. Jacek Paluszak ([@palushak](https://github.com/palushak)).

## Classes

Neural network can recognize following classes of images:
- cables
- case
- cpu
- gpu
- hdd
- headset
- keyboard
- microphone
- monitor
- motherboard
- mouse
- ram
- speakers
- webcam

## Example dataset

Example of the dataset for this network can be found on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/pc-parts-images-dataset-classification).
